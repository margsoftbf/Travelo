  "description": "The Knickerbocker, a member of Leading Hotels of the World, reopened its doors in February 2015 as the only Five-Star hotel in Times Square, after completing an expansive $250 million renovation by acclaimed interior designers Gabellini Sheppard. The Beaux Arts monument to New York's coming of age is situated at the southeast corner of 42nd Street between Broadway and Bryant Park. The hotel originally opened in 1906 by John Jacob Astor IV and welcomed both glitterati and dignitaries including such notables as Enrico Caruso, John D Rockefeller and F. Scott Fitzgerald. A New York City landmark, The Knickerbocker boasts 330 guest rooms including 31 suites; a signature restaurant and bar, Charlie Palmer at The Knick; St. Cloud-a 7,800-square-foot rooftop bar; a 2,200-square-foot event space for up to 160 guests; a ground level café, Jake's; and a state-of-the art fitness center.",

  "description": "The latest Freehand in NYC’s Flatiron neighborhood opened in 2018. The Freehand takes over the former George Washington Hotel, which has a history as a home for creatives and is listed on the U.S National Register of Historic Places. Freehand New York is designed by Roman and Williams and features custom-commissioned artwork throughout the property as well as one of a kind murals in every guest room by Bard College students and alumni. As with all Freehands, Food and Beverage is of the utmost importance. Comodo opened in Oct 2021 with a Latin American inspired menu serving vibrant & bold flavors that invite you to get comfortable, let your guard down and enjoy. Broken Shaker, our award winning rooftop oasis, serves up specialty cocktails and yummy bites with beautiful skyline views of NYC. In November 2021, our mezzanine spaces were reconceptualized, refreshed and recharged. Enter Georgia Room and Bar Calico, inspired by iconic painter Georgia O’Keeffe-when in doubt dance it out.",
